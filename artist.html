Women in their 60s—who were in their mid-20s during the 1980s—were interviewed for their insights into the era's sewing techniques, fabrics, and design preferences. These insights informed a follow-up questionnaire for young women today, examining which elements of 1980s fashion they would incorporate into their personal style. The results reveal a cyclical dynamic, in which bold silhouettes, structured designs, and vibrant colours from the 1980s are selectively reimagined to align with modern aesthetics.",

Accompanying the poetry is a series of full illustrations depicting the space of her room, transforming it into a surreal landscape that blurs the boundaries between dreams and reality. These illustrations not only visualize her experiences but also reference the orally spoken Maltese folktale Il-Ħaddiela, drawing connections between folklore and the haunting nature of sleep paralysis. Through this multidisciplinary approach, Federica weaves together personal narrative, cultural heritage, and artistic expression to create a deeply immersive and introspective body of work.",

As the story unfolds, shifting perspectives increasingly blur the line between truth and deception, creating suspense and uncertainty. Through ambiguous characters, the animation explores the complexities of human behavior.

By drawing from the statistics she has meticulously gathered over the past several months, the exhibition seeks to transform abstract ideas into tangible forms that reflect the hidden patterns and rhythms behind artistic creation. To deepen her exploration, Camilleri reached out to a select group of esteemed artists within the Maltese art community, inviting them to share remnants and fragments from their personal creative journeys. The resulting display includes not only selected works from these artists but also the raw, physical elements associated with each piece — such as sketches, paint-stained tools, or discarded materials — which are repurposed to represent data.. These materials offer visitors an intimate glimpse into the behind-the-scenes evolution of creative thought. Through Fragments, Camilleri aims to provoke reflection on how creativity defies linearity and instead unfolds in unexpected and deeply personal ways. ",

By integrating interactive elements into the storytelling, the project explores themes of identity, growth, and creative inspiration, demonstrating how reader agency can enhance engagement and deepen immersion in narrative-driven comics.",

The work challenges the conventions of static architecture by promoting adaptability, embodiment, and sensory engagement. Drawing from traditional architectural theory and contemporary digital arts, the project seeks to create immersive environments that bridge the physical and digital realms, fostering dynamic user experiences and reimagining the role of architecture as an interactive medium.",

A stylized interactive turntable invites users to explore the 3D environment, decode narrative clues, and engage with quizzes rooted in local legends, rewarding deeper engagement with Maltese cultural heritage. By blending speculative fiction aesthetics, mythic symbolism, and archetypal storytelling, the work bridges past and present, transforming folklore into an immersive experience that preserves Malta’s intangible legacy for contemporary audiences.",

The project is developed in Blender, an open-source 3D software that supports modelling, texture painting, shading, animation, and compositing. The film adopts an illustrative, hand-painted, non-photorealistic style inspired by traditional painting. Scene design draws from both personal experience and real-world references, with each environment constructed to reflect shifts in mood, tone, and spatial composition. For example, early environments feature soft lighting, pastel colours, and organic shapes to suggest openness, while later scenes introduce colder palettes, rigid geometry, and reduced detail to convey structure and control. These stylistic differences are not decorative choices but intentional compositional decisions that reinforce the film’s narrative.",

Through a written dissertation and the development of a VR prototype, I examine techniques and theories used in popular cozy and horror video games, such as classical conditioning, colour psychology, and the Sheperd tone. The VR prototype highlights the power of contrast, transitioning from a tense, creepy environment to a calm, welcoming one. Built in Unreal Engine 5, this project also served as a personal journey into 3D design and interactive media, showcasing VR’s unique capacity to evoke emotional and sensory engagement.",

Players retrace the steps of a vanished archaeologist through puzzles, fragmented diary pages, and spatial storytelling—uncovering knowledge and confronting blurred lines between history and myth. The experience transforms cultural heritage into an interactive narrative, where discovery is felt as much as understood. By embedding story into space, motion, and interaction, The Lost Notes explores how mythology is preserved through presence—inviting players not just to observe the past but to step inside it.",
